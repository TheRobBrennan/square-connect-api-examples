# Welcome

This project was based on the original examples from [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en) at [https://github.com/square/connect-api-examples](https://github.com/square/connect-api-examples).

I've opted to create a separate repo just to track my notes and thoughts.

Given that this is an educational resource and will only be used for development/sandbox testing, I'm going to follow the path of just leaving those IDs and tokens in for now. They should be environment variables, but for demonstration purposes it's fine.
